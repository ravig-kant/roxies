# roxies
This project provides a framework for developing Socks proxies and an implementation. The project is named after the implementation which is a routing proxy (roxies). 
The framework provides classes which takes care of some of the basic needs of proxy such as server, listener for client connection, configuration manager (TBD), context management, thread control, socks5 compliant value objects etc. The most important goal of the project is to provide object orient model for proxy implementations.
Plan is to add following features too:

    1. Secure proxy
    2. A plain old proxy
